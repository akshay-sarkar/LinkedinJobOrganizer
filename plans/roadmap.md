# Roadmap

---

## Planned Features

- [ ] Auto-dark mode based on system preference
- [ ] Export to JSON / PDF in addition to CSV
- [ ] Bulk actions (select multiple jobs, bulk delete / mark applied)
- [ ] Job application deadline tracking
- [ ] Notes field on each job card
- [ ] Filter by date range presets (Last 7 days, This month, etc.)

---

## Known Issues / Tech Debt

- [ ] Old `frontend/` directory still exists in the repo (can be removed once confirmed unused)
- [ ] ThemeProvider exists but dark mode UI toggle was removed during Next.js migration
- [ ] Setup checklist still references "Frontend Features to Build" as TODO items that are already done
- [ ] No end-to-end tests

## Ideas / Backlog

- Chrome extension for quick-adding jobs from LinkedIn
- Email notifications when new jobs match saved searches
- Interview scheduling integration
- Application pipeline view (Applied -> Interview -> Offer -> Rejected)
- Analytics dashboard with charts (apply rate, response rate)
- Share job lists with others
- Multi-account Gmail support
